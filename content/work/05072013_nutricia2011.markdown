This project was done pairing with [Luisa D'Arnaude](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Luisa+D%27Arnaude), who is a graphic designer, and me, as sole coder. At the time I basically forked [Mr.doob](http://www.mrdoob.com/#/91/ball_pool) fabulous idea and extended to work on IE8 or superior, plus added some small tweaks here and there ([Box2d](http://box2d.org/) and compatibility issues), added some extra content, music and voil√†!
