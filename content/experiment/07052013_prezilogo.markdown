# Drawing with maths

### GLSL raymarched Prezi logo

This is one of the main reason why I love to be a graphic programmer, experimenting with complex maths yet visible results. This is a Prezi logo done with ray marching (inspired by [IQ](http://www.iquilezles.org/) awesome work) and embedded into [Three.js](http://threejs.org/).  

Also I couldn't refrain myself from trying out [Coffescript](http://coffeescript.org/) for the Javascript part of the project. I must admit that I am getting addicted to these meta languages that compile into Web technologies (its just like C++ compiling to assembly feeling). Nothing fancy by today's standars but I still find it very cool.
