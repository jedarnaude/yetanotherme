# A website, at last

### Roadmap to internet visibility

Finally its up an running! After quite a good amount of failed attemps, I finally have
my own website for my experiments, rants or simply to toy with. It took me quite a long time to have a reasonable project as I had a hard time deciding what tools or frameworks to use and also, what aesthetic I wanted for it. 

After many test ranging from straight HTML5/CSS3 coding to Ruby frameworks, I've landed with a nice environment to work, in which fast iterations are king. I use several tools for different purposes but they all combine perfectly:  

* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS coding, which allows rapid modifcations of the overall look.  
* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) as template engine for HTML generation, simple and clean code.  
* [Coffescript](http://coffeescript.org/) for the Javascript part of the project.  
* [Python](http://www.python.org/) for custom tools that simplify my pipeline.  
* [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) for live reloading, worth every penny.  

The whole website is staticly created in my computer and uploaded to the server with a single command from my [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) editor. Therefore I can iterate in my local computer, and once its done just need to upload new data into my webserver without the hassle of backend admin management. At last I use [github](https://github.com/jedarnaude/yetanotherme) for version control. I wanted a clean nice and simple solution that I am comfortable with, and I've managed to create mine.
