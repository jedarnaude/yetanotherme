# YetAnother.me website

## Description

This repository contains code and articles for my personal [website](http://www.yetanother.me/). The basic idea behind is an easy to manage website that currently has no backend requirements. All code is compiled in my local computer and uploaded using python utilities to my webserver.

## Usage

*WARNING: This code is not meant to be forked "as is".  The code is very coupled to my requirements, yet usage is provided in order to let others understand the workflow.*

## FAQ

___Why are you using github for your website content instead of something more private such as [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)?___  
I use github at work on daily basis, and nothing in my content is that sensitive so far. If I ever have something sensitive I will either use Bitbucket or pay github for its service.
